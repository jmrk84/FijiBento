FijiBento
=========

This fork of FijiBento was created to be used with jmrk84 / Alignment_Projects (Bill Karsh's Affine Alignment tool for large serial image datasets) and contains additional scripts that parse the output of the aligner and write the json tilespecs used by the FijiBento rendering.
